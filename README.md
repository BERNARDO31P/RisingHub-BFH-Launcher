# RisingHub

This here is the RisingHub Battlefield Heroes launcher written in Java, the original version is in C#. 
This launcher was intentional written for people which use Linux/Mac. Sadly the game itself does not run on Linux, so this project is set on hold.

You have the permission to fork this project and continue it.

Thank you, and have fun coding!
